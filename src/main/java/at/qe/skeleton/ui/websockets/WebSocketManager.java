/**
 * Due to technical restrictions (see [1] and [2]), spring cannot initialize the
 * pushContexts required for websockets (with simpler words: autowiring does not
 * work). Only a CDI-implementation (in our case "Weld" by jBoss) is capable of
 * doing that. Hence this class is used as a "container" for the required
 * pushContexts which is fully managed by CDI and excluded from the spring
 * DI-capabilities (autowiring, etc...).
 *
 * Doing this way, the webSocketManager's fields, i.e. the various pushContexts,
 * can be initialized properly and accessed over this class within a
 * spring-managed bean. DO NOT mix spring-annotations with CDI annotations AND
 * only use this manager for managing push-contexts!
 *
 * If you require additional pushContexts, just append them and include a proper
 * getter for it. Please note that if you don't specify any channel-name, the
 * name of the variable will be used instead.
 *
 *
 * This class is part of the skeleton project provided for students of the
 * courses "Software Architecture" and "Software Engineering" offered by the
 * University of Innsbruck.
